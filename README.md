## Background
Aerobot was created over the summer of 2019 for one of my aerospace engineering professors.

There were some tedious calculations in his class that involved scanning through _so many pages_ of data in the back of our textbook.

My professor, however, had a handy Fortran CLI script that allowed him to more quickly run the calculations.

I partnered with him to create an accessible, mobile interface for his script that students could use from their smartphones!

The version of Aerobot in this repo is modernized from the original 2019 version.
