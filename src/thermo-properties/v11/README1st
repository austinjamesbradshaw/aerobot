This directory includes the routines that model air and stoichiometric
gas properties (based on tables used in AERO351). You need to do the
following (on a unix/linux machine):

1/ gunzip tables.tar.gz
2/ tar xvf tables.tar

Then read README and check the main.f file for an example. On unix/linux,
you can create an executable "example" by typing: make.
