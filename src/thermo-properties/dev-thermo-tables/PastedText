Attached is the file with the routines that model air and
stoichiometric gas properties (based on tables used in AERO351). You
need to do the following (on a unix machine):

tar xvfz tables.tgz

Then read README and check the main.f file for an example. On unix,
you can create an executable "example" by typing: make.

I also included a folder sample that can be used as a template for
calling these subroutines.
